Because PCAPs take up a large amount of space, and because GitHub does not support large binary files, use this folder to store downloaded PCAP and other relevant testing files.

PCAPs can be downloaded from the following link:

For eve.json files, when testing the Logstash Pipeline portion of Malcolm (without obtaining eve.json file via Suricata),
use test.json to get reproducable output with the testing procedure. Note that you when following the testing procedure for
testing the Suricata Logstash pipeline, you will need to rename test.json to be eve.json at some point before running Malcolm.
Additionally, this file needs to be moved to be in the /data/zeek/current path of Filebeat before starting Malcolm.
